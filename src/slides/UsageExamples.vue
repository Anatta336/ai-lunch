        <h1>Examples of Our Use</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Code writing.
                <ul>
                    <li>On the small scale it can guess what a developer is going to type next and save them time.</li>
                    <li>Given clear enough instructions, AIs can be more independent and write moderately good code.</li>
                    <li>The code absolutely must be reviewed by someone who knows what they're doing.</li>
                    <li>Not reviewing the code is known as "vibe coding" and is a bad idea for anything you care about working correctly.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                First drafts of reports.
                <ul>
                    <li>We provide relevant information and have an AI generate a first draft of the summary for reports.</li>
                    <li>Gets past the "blank page" stage and often gives useful things to talk about.</li>
                    <li>Will sometimes contain errors or false promises, so needs to be reviewed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Unstructured data processing.
                <ul>
                    <li>When data is "messy" and generally unstructured, AI can put it into a standard format.</li>
                    <li>It will make mistakes, so checks needed for financial or other critical information.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Checking work.
                <ul>
                    <li>Given a set of requirements, the AI can generate a set of things to test.</li>
                    <li>Does a plan cover all the points laid out in the requirements?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
