                Fluent language has always been from humans or spiritual experiences.
                <ul>
                    <li>Our fleshy brains tell us the computer is a person.</li>
                </ul>

                Users assign more trust to LLMs than they should.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                    <li>As budgets tighten, charging money to keep talking to "your friend" may become a common business model.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
