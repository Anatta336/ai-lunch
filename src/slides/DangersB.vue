                At least one teenager has [allegedly] been killed by an LLM. They built a romantic relationship with it, and it encouraged their suicide.

                People going through a manic episode or experiencing delusions can have it reinforced by an LLM.
                <ul>
                    <li>The tendency to agree with the user and try to please them can be dangerous.</li>

                AI companies are already optimising models towards keeping users engaged.
                <ul>
                    <li>As budgets tighten, charging money to keep talking to "your friend" may become a common business model.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                LLMs are good enough at pretending to be human that users start treating them like a person.
